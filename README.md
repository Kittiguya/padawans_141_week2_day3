help.py is the import string for the square footage and the cirumference on the Day3_Lesson_INCLASS.ipynb

I did struggle a bit using it. Come to find out i wasnt importing the import methods to import from the python document. 

I need to find or make my own cheat sheet to help build these functions. Internet doesnt seem to have what i need to make it super simplictic on my part.
